i) The answer is c . For loop will work once even when the 
condition is false.

ii) The answer is (b) break.Inside the while or for loop
break says that there is no need to continue.

iii) Break is for breaking the repetition and continuing the process
right after when while or for is closed at.It means when u enter some
condition inside while and if it;s true u say break.This means
there is no meaning to continue the process inside the loop.Because
CONDITION IS TRUE for us.
But continue, it's also used inside loops.This also ruins the repetition's 
normal moving.But in the other direction.Example: When u say continue
in one condition inside a loop, it means there is no need to continue 
your work after command "Continue".Please go back where the repetition
began and start your work again from there.Till the condition if FALSE.
